            "Bio": "Prof. Dr. Murat Görgülü was born in Ermenek/Karaman in 1963 and graduated from Çukurova University Faculty of Agriculture Dept. of Animal Science in 1986. He accomplished his MSc and PhD degrees in the same department respectively in 1990 and 1994. He did some research studies in Poland through the grant of Ministry of Education and 3 months in Holland through grant of OECD. Later he visited several countries for exchange of knowledge and experience. He contributed to animal nutrition science by publishing 3 books and so many articles  and he also presented many paper in national and international congresses all related to ruminant nutrition. He supervised so many students not only Turkish but also from other nationalities. One of his published books is related to dairy cows nutrition the other is related to fattening cattle for red meat production. He also contributed to the field nutritionists by publishing a Total Mixed Ration (TMR) for large and small ruminants. He is conducting two web site, www.muratgorgulu.com.tr  and  www.ruminantbesleme.com  where he supported the animal production sector with up-to-date  important information. Professor Görgülü has been serving animal production and feed sectors as a consultant.",

Van Soest. And Co-chair A.N. Pell. He is teaching undergraduate courses; Animal Nutrition and Feeding, Feeding Techniques, Diet Formulation and Balancing for Ruminant. He was Erasmus Coordinator (1998-2004) and Chair in the Dept. of Animal Science of the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Sassari since 2005. He was Chair of 11 Ph.D. students, and gave Ph.D. courses in 8 different universities, of which 5 abroad. Professor Cannas’ main areas of research: ruminant nutrition, with special focus on small ruminants; feed evaluation and palatability; energy and protein requirements of ruminants; rumen function and turnover; milk urea as nutritional indicator; factors affecting milk composition of small ruminants; environmental impact of animal production; indicator of feeding and economic efficiency of ruminants. He was invited speaker in 18 symposia and work-shops, of which 12 abroad. Referee of 12 international scientific journal. He authored of more than 160 scientific and technical publications, and edited the book: Cannas A., Pulina G., Eds. 2008. Dairy goats feeding and nutrition. CAB International, Wallingford, UK. He led the development of the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System for Sheep and of its evolution into the Small Ruminant Nutrition System (co-owned and authored with D. G. Fox, Cornell University, USA and L.O. Tedeschi, Texas A & M University, USA). The equations used in these models to predict energy and protein requirements of sheep were adopted as reference equations by the NRC (2007). Nutrient requirements of small ruminants.
